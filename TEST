Attendance records (sign-in sheets) are no longer manually signed. US attendees must provide a Deloitte-issued mobile telephone number when registering. In order to ensure your attendance is properly recorded, please be sure to update your Deloitte mobile information by accessing the following link, <a href="http://deloittenet.deloitte.com/CB/Info/Pages/APP_MyContactInfo.aspx" target="_blank">Update My Information</a> and include your current Deloitte mobile phone number by selecting Contact Details--&gt;Office Information--&gt;Mobile.</small></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><big>Attendance by Spouses/Guests and Other Family Members</big><br />
<small>Attendance by spouse/guests is not permitted. Training seminars constitute a major expense to the firm. We endeavor to make them as productive as possible, including building camaraderie and teamwork through social interaction. The role of a facilitator/participant includes the responsibility to be part of this activity. The presence of outside visitors is a distraction that reduces the opportunity to fulfill this responsibility. Therefore, neither facilitators nor participants should be accompanied to meetings by spouses, other family members, or guests.</small></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><big>Attire</big><br />
<small>The dress code at Deloitte University is business casual as is our current office dress code. Comfortable shoes are important as the facility is a quarter mile in length. If you wish to take advantage of DFit, please bring appropriate gym clothes and sneakers.<br />
<br />
For evening events, we trust that you will exercise discretion at all times, recognizing that whether you are in a classroom, at a social event, or in the Market or Barn, Deloitte University is a professional environment.</small></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><big>Meals</big><br />
<small>All meals will be provided during your stay.</small></div>
